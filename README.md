# Hospital-Management-System-using-PHP
INTRODUCTION 
1. Description 
Hospital are the essential part of our lives, providing best medical facilities to 
people suffering from various ailments, which may be due to change in climatic 
conditions, increased work-load, emotional trauma stress etc. It is necessary 
for the hospitals to keep track of its day-to-day activities & records of its 
patients, doctors, nurses, ward boys and other staff personals that keep the 
hospital running smoothly & successfully. 
But keeping track of all the activities and their records on paper is very 
cumbersome and error prone. It also is very inefficient and a time-consuming 
process Observing the continuous increase in population and number of 
people visiting the hospital. Recording and maintaining all these records is 
highly unreliable, inefficient and error-prone. It is also not economically & 
technically feasible to maintain these records on paper. 
Thus keeping the working of the manual system as the basis of our project. 
We have developed an automated version of the manual system, named as 
"Hospital Management System". 
The main aim of our project is to provide a paper-less hospital up to 90%. It 
also aims at providing low-cost reliable automation of the existing systems. 
The system also provides excellent security of data at every level of usersystem interaction and also provides robust & reliable storage and backup 
facilities 
2. Objectives 
The project "Hospital management system" is aimed to develop to maintain 
the day-to-day state of admission/discharge of patients, list of doctors, and 
other employees. It is designed to achieve the following objectives: 
1. To computerise all details regarding patient details & hospital details. 
2. Storing the data of patient with doctors to make it convenient for both. 
3. Same login form for the different types of employee. 
4. If the patient is discharged or some employee has left the hospital so fast 
deletion of data can happen. 
5. It should be able to handle the large amount of data. 
6. A page which authorise the person if he/she is the employee or not 
7. The information of the patients should be kept up to date and there record 
should be kept in the system for historical purposes.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS 
1. Our first thing was to make form validation using JavaScript. For this we had 
used the text editor like Notepad, VS Code for writing the code. 
2. Than we have to run that code of Java Script to see the output for which we 
have used any web browser like Google Chrome and etc. 
3. Second thing was to make the database connectivity. For this also we had 
used the text editor like Notepad, VS Code for writing the php code. 
4. We had used the server such as XAMPP server for running the php script on 
to our browser. 
5. We had used the MySQL to store our data to database. 
6. We had used PhpMyAdmin for connectivity of php script to database.

DESIGN STRATEGY 
1. Java script with HTML page is made which links to the first php page. All 
the code was written in the Notepad. Firstly a function was made which 
validates the form if the person is entering the correct email or not. If the 
person enters the correct email than he/she will enter into the php index page 
else they will be warned with "Not valid email". Than a whole form was made 
which has two parts email entry and the submit button and at last the 
customisation was done with the creativity and some templates. 

Output2. Index page of the project was made with the php script using text editor VS 
Code which links the different parts of the project by entering the employee 
code. Login page is made in which employee id is taken as input and if right 
than the respective page opens with that employee id. A form is made which 
also has two values one is Employee id and other is submit button which 
redirects to other pages at last the customisation was done with the creativity 
and some templates. 

Output3. Different pages of PHP are made on VS Code like 
nurse,receptionist,login,logout etc. which is connected to index page and the 
database which gives the different output on different employee code. Doctor's 
employee code redirects to the respective doctors page where the details of all 
the patient served by the doctor is shown. Nurse's employee code redirects to 
the respective nurses page where the details of all the patient served by the 
nurse is shown. Receptionist's employee code redirects to the page where all 
the entry and deletion of employees and patient is shown. It also shows the 
table of employee and patients. 

Output(Receptionist)- 
3. Database is made using MySQL and PhpMyAdmin and connected to Php 
pages using Xampp server. 

CONCLUSION 
Here is our project which is validated by JavaScript and made with the Php 
and stores the data in the database.
